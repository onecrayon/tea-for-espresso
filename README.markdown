Textmate Emulation Actions for Espresso
---------------------------------------

Textmate Emulation Actions (TEA) are some of my favorite actions from
Textmate implemented as an [Espresso][1] Sugar. For general information,
including download links, see the official [TEA for Espresso][2] page.

If you are interested in extending or modifying the TEA for Espresso Sugar
for your own use, then you've come to the right place.

Extending TEA for Espresso
==========================

TEA for Espresso is coded in [Python][3] and can be easily extended with
your own custom actions.  If you are instead interested in coding your own
Sugar in Python, the TEA for Espresso project can serve as an excellent
starting point.  For more information about extending or building on TEA
for Espresso, please see the [wiki][4].
