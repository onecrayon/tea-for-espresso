Text Editor Actions for Espresso
--------------------------------

Text Editor Actions (TEA) for Espresso (formerly Textmate Emulation
Actions) are some of the text manipulation actions that
I think every text editor should have, implemented as an [Espresso][1]
Sugar. I originally began work on TEA because I wanted to use Espresso
but couldn't bear to abandon some of my favorite Textmate workflows, but
it has since grown into a general use platform for extending the application
in ways useful to my everyday work as a web developer.

For general information, including download links, see the official
[TEA for Espresso][2] page.

If you are interested in extending or modifying TEA for Espresso
for your own use, then you've come to the right place.

Extending TEA for Espresso
==========================

TEA for Espresso is coded in [Python][3] and can be easily extended with
your own custom actions either by writing your own Python scripts or simply
by editing the TEA for Espresso Actions.xml file to use existing actions
in new ways.  If you are instead interested in coding your own
Sugar in Python, the TEA for Espresso project can also serve as an excellent
starting point.  You can find more information in the [wiki][4].
